# Mission Log: 01
## Codename: Consecration of the Ark

### Objective
To establish a professional, version-controlled repository structure that will serve as the foundation for all future missions.

### Required Rites
- [x] Establish a connection to the Great Temple (GitHub).
- [x] Consecrate the local ground (git init).
- [x] Inscribe the main chronicle (README.md).
- [x] Erect the protective wards (.gitignore).
- [x] Define the Ark's structure (directory creation).

### Analysis
All foundational rites have been performed. The Ark is ready for its first official project: a script that will document its own structure.
